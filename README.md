# Electronics Online Shop

Made in ASP.net C# MVC. 
The project works with entity framework and it is connected to MSSQLLocalDB.

Used a free bootstrap template and modified it so the next things work:

Account:
Log in
Register

Products:
Edit/Delete/Create
Working stock update after product buy by the account.

User orders:
Linked to the cart that is owned by the account. Cart - Account is one to one relationship.
Shows every order made in the specific cart.

A view that shows the product stock.
